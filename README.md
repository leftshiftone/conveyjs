Convey is a JavaScript Framework for connecting to processes created with [G.A.I.A.](https://www.leftshift.one/produkt/gaia-services/).

The framework ist compatible with all major Browsers and can be used standalone as well as in conjunction with React, Angular or Vue.

### Prerequisites
[//]: <> (TODO: Create sample project to demonstrate integration)
In order to add Convey to your project, follow these steps:
1. MQTT endpoint: e.g. wss://gaia.local/mqtt
2. Identifier of the so called *Identity* to connect to.

## Installation

Using npm:
```bash
$ npm i @leftshiftone/convey
```

Using in browser:
```html
<script src="convey-std.js"/>
```

## Usage

Create the following DOM structure in your project

```html
<div class="lto-gaia">
    <div class="lto-content"></div>
        <div class="lto-suggest"/>
        <input class="lto-textbox"/>
        <button class="lto-invoker"/>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Integrate Convey as standalone lib
Import Convey
```html
<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="convey-std.css"/>
   <script src="convey-std.js"/>
</head>
```

Connect to the G.A.I.A. ecosystem
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    new GaiaConvey.Gaia(
        new GaiaConvey.ContentCentricRenderer(),
        new GaiaConvey.OffSwitchListener()
    ).connect('wss://DOMAIN_NAME/mqtt', 'IDENTITY_ID')
        .then(connection => {
            connection.subscribe(GaiaConvey.ChannelType.CONTEXT, (data) => console.log(data));
            connection.reception();
        });
</script>
```

#### Integrate Convey as NPM package
Import Convey
```javascript
import {Gaia, ContentCentricRenderer, OffSwitchListener, ChannelType} from "@leftshiftone/convey";
```

Connect to the G.A.I.A. ecosystem
```javascript
new Gaia(new ContentCentricRenderer(), new OffSwitchListener())
    .connect('wss://DOMAIN_NAME/mqtt', 'IDENTITY_ID')
    .then(connection => {
        connection.subscribe(ChannelType.CONTEXT, (data) => console.log(data));
        connection.reception();
    });
```

To use the default styling you can import it like the following:
```javascript
import '@leftshiftone/convey/dist/convey-all.css';
```

## Channels

The communication with G.A.I.A. contains several channels where each one has its own purpose.

### TEXT
The Text channel is the main channel and is responsible for exchanging the elements configured in
G.A.I.A.. Convey automatically subscribes to this channel by calling `connection.reception()`.
The messages in this channel are rendered to HTML elements.

### CONTEXT
The Context consists of attributes defined in the G.A.I.A. BPMN process. It can be received by
subscribing to this channel.

### NOTIFICATION
Each notification configured in the G.A.I.A. BPMN process can be received if subscribed to this channel.

### LOG
G.A.I.A. sends logs for certain process executions which can be received by subscribing to this channel.


## Renderer

A Renderer defines how elements, which were received by the 'Text' channel, are rendered in
the HTML DOM tree. Furthermore, a renderer specifies the layout of an integration project.

### Classic Renderer
The classic renderer renders the G.A.I.A. messages in a classic top-down manner.

### Content Centric Renderer
The content centric renderer tries to maximize the time a content is visible by updating the content
if possible or displaying interrupting actions like intent cascading by overlaying the content.

### RevealJS Renderer
Renderer implementation which is based on the reveal.js library. This renderer supports horizontal
as well as vertical navigation.

### NoopRenderer
No-operation dummy renderer. Mainly used for audio only use cases.


## Listener

A listener provides the functionality to react to certain events. Events can be
* Connected
* ConnectionLost
* PacketSend
* Disconnected
* Error
* Message

### Default Listener
Acts as the base listener.

### OffSwitch Listener
If an input text area should only be visible when a input is required, this is the listener to be used.


## Modules

The following modules are available:
* std: Contains default modules
* aud: Contains the audio module
* cod: Contains the code reader module (e.g. QRCode)
* map: Contains modules for Open Street Map, Google Maps and Here Maps
* vis: Contains modules for rendering data as charts
* all: Contains all modules


## Development

### Release
Releases are triggered locally. Just a tag will be pushed to trigger the CI release pipeline.

#### Major
Run `yarn trigger-release:major` locally.

#### Minor
Run `yarn trigger-release:minor` locally.

#### Patch
